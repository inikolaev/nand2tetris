In this repository I'm doing a computer implementation which is described in "[The Elements of Computer Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems)" by Nisan and Schoken.

Additional resources:

* Book companion [web-site](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)
* [Nand2Tetris I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) Coursera course
* [Nand2Tetris II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) Coursera course
* This book doesn't cover this topic, but you might be interested in learning about Veitch Diagram and [Karnaugh Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) which are some of the methods to minimize boolean expressions.
